Possible things TODO:
1. Add method to Thesaurus that removes entries from the Thesaurus
2. Add methods to Entry that add more synonyms/antonyms to an existing Entry.
3. As of now, the only way to look up synonyms in the thesaurus is thesaurus.entries["happy"].synonyms. Create a cleaner lookup method(s) that looks up synonyms/antonyms in the thesaurus.
Example: thesaurus.synonyms("happy")
4. When creating new entries, create mirror entries based on synonyms. For example, if we add to a thesaurus an Entry for "happy" that has a synonym "glad", that should automatically create an entry for "glad" that has a synonym "happy".
Edge cases: 1) Ideally, this should work when adding an entry with multiple synonyms. 2) If one of the mirror entries already exist, it should just add the new synonyms and not create a new entry.
5. Develop a cleaner API for initializing Thesaurus/Entry.
Example:
Thesaurus.new do
  entry "happy" do
    synonyms ["glad", "gleeful"]
    antonyms ["sad", "mad"]
  end
end

NOTE: Be sure this works for adding multiple entries.
